I am Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study and Toulouse School of Economics ([IAST](https://www.iast.fr/)/[TSE](https://www.tse-fr.eu/fr)). 
I obtained my PhD in Economics at [UCLouvain](https://www.uclouvain.be/fr) in September 2025. 

I use applied microeconomics tools to study how people, ideas, and institutions shape long-term growth. While much of my work takes a historical perspective, my research more broadly explores questions related to migration, education, and innovation.

Early Modern Academies, Universities, and Economic Growth

Knowledge production is vital to modern progress, but what about the past? Pre-industrial European academic institutions are often assumed to have been flawed, with misallocated resources and talent. In this paper, I examine the role of academies, dynamic and scientifically oriented institutions that emerged between 1650 and 1800. Using new data on historical European academia and advanced difference-in-difference methods, I find that academies contributed to long-term urban growth. Exploiting individual-level data on scholars, I further show that literary academies had no long-term effect, whereas scientific academies led to persistent growth. Finally, I demonstrate that academies had positive spillover effects, both on the growth of neighboring cities and on the quality of pre-existing universities. Altogether, I provide the first empirical evidence of the pivotal role scientific academies played in Europeâ€™s economic growth.
