I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study and Toulouse School of Economics ([IAST](https://www.iast.fr/)/[TSE](https://www.tse-fr.eu/fr)). 
I obtained my PhD in Economics at [UCLouvain](https://www.uclouvain.be/fr) in September 2025. 

I use applied microeconomics tools to study how people, ideas, and institutions shape long-term growth. While much of my work takes a historical perspective, my research more broadly explores questions related to migration, education, and innovation.
