I am a PhD Candidate at [IRES](https://uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/lidam/ires)/[LIDAM](https://uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/lidam), [UCLouvain](https://uclouvain.be/en/index.html). I am also part of the [European Doctoral Program](https://uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/lidam/core/edp.html). 

I will visit [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/) in Winter and Spring 2024. 

My current research interests are economic history, human capital, and long-term growth.
