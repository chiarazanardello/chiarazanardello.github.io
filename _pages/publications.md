Early Modern Academies, Universities, and Growth

This project explores the impact of the upper tail of human capital distribution on European economic growth from 1500 to 1900. I investigate the role of academies, of universities, and of the interaction of these two types of institutions. Using an original database of scholars, I define this interaction as the set of scholars active in both the university and the academy located in the same city. I proxy the economic growth of European cities with their population. I develop the main results of the paper implementing staggered event studies. I also include additional results using recent DID estimators for heterogeneous and inter-temporal treatment effects. In future stages, I will develop an instrumental variable approach to further mitigate endogeneity issues, and I will also exploit data on innovation and patents by country to deepen the analysis.
