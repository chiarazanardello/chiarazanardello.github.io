[**Early Modern Academies, Universities, and Economic Growth**](https://chiarazanardello.github.io/files/zanardello_jmp.pdf) (Job Market Paper) *LIDAM Discussion Paper - 2024/12*

*Abstract.* Knowledge production is vital to modern progress, but what about the past? Pre-industrial European academic institutions are often assumed to have been flawed, with misallocated resources and talent. In this paper, I examine the role of academies, dynamic and scientifically oriented institutions that emerged between 1650 and 1800. Using new data on historical European academia and advanced difference-in-difference methods, I find that academies contributed to long-term urban growth. Exploiting individual-level data on scholars, I further show that literary academies had no long-term effect, whereas scientific academies led to persistent growth. Finally, I demonstrate that academies had positive spillover effects, both on the growth of neighboring cities and on the quality of pre-existing universities. Altogether, I provide the first empirical evidence of the pivotal role scientific academies played in Europe’s economic growth.

[**Salvation, Plants, and Cosmos: How Pre-modern Academia Spread Ideas**](https://chiarazanardello.github.io/files/spread-of-ideas.pdf) *(with David de la Croix, and Rossana Scebba)*

*Abstract.* While having good ideas is not uncommon, their spread and evolution require a community. In premodern Europe (1084-1793), approximately 200 universities and 150 academies of sciences gathered thousands of scholars, shaping an extensive network of intellectual exchange. By reconstructing inter-personal connections through institutional affiliations, we demonstrate how the European academic landscape facilitated the diffusion of ideas and led cities to develop -- examples include botanic gardens, astronomical observatories, and Protestantism. Counterfactual simulations reveal that both universities and academies played crucial roles, with academies being particularly effective in connecting distant parts of the network. Moreover, we show that idea diffusion through the network remains remarkably resilient, even after the removal of key regions such as England or France. In Europe, ideas gain significance being effectively channelled by powerful institutions.

[RETE](https://ojs.uclouvain.be/index.php/RETE/index) is a collection of data papers, summarizing information on the scholars who taught at premodern European universities or were members of scientific academies. The period covered goes from the emergence of the first universities (1000CE) to the eve of the Industrial Revolution (1800CE).
