* [Early Modern Academies, Universities, and Economic Growth](https://chiarazanardello.github.io/files/zanardello_jmp.pdf)

*Abstract.* Using a novel micro-level database on Early Modern scholars and educational institutions, I investigate the links between knowledge production and Europe's economic growth from 1500 to 1800. Micro-level data on scholars' fields of study reveal that literary academies contribute to an initial decline of population growth rates, an effect that dissipates over time. In contrast, scientific academies drive urban growth 15% faster after 100 years and this effect persists.
Additionally, I test the historical evidence about academies fostering universities' reforms and innovations by showing that scientific academies associate with higher quality of universities in the same cities. Overall, this paper provides the first evidence of the pivotal role scientific academies played in Europe's economic growth and the modernization of its universities.

* Salvation, Plants, and Cosmos: How Pre-modern Universities Spread Ideas *(with David de la Croix, and Rossana Scebba)*

*Abstract.* Having a few good ideas in a lifetime is not uncommon, but for those ideas to spread and evolve, a community is essential. About 200 universities operated in premodern Europe. Together with about 150 academies of sciences which blossomed in the 17th century, they employed thousands of scholars. The ideas developed by these individuals spread across time and space through these institutions. By building a network of scholars exchanging ideas through institutional affiliations (intention to treat), we demonstrate how the European academic landscape exposed cities to new ideas, influencing their development. We highlight examples such as Protestantism, Botanic Gardens, and the publication of calendars. Through counterfactual simulations, we show that both universities and academies played a crucial role, with their interaction proving especially impactful. Ideas gain significance when effectively channelled by powerful institutions.
